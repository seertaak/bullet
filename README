Bullet is a multi-paradigm (i.e. functional, imperative, and object-oriented) 
lisp for the JVM. It is currently interpreted. It features a line processor 
similar to python's, which along with bullet's infix B-expr structuring 
operators make your code cleaner and easier to edit. Bullet features tight 
interop with Java: bullet primitives are Java primitives, and method invocation 
and field access have a syntax analogous to function invocation.

Examples of bullet code reside in the src/main/bullet directory.
To run a bullet script, go into said directory and run the bash shell
script 'bt'. This in turn calls java with

target/bullet-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT-jar-with-dependencies.jar

which is the version of the jar file that contains all the dependencies required
for the project. If you already have the dependencies on your classpath,
then you can use the smaller bullet-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar.
